## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install CORS Extension (IMPORTANT!)

Since this project uses AJIO's real API, you need to install a CORS unblock extension:

**For Chrome:**

- Install "CORS Unblock" extension from Chrome Web Store
- Or install "Moesif Origin & CORS Changer" extension

**For Firefox:**

- Install "CORS Everywhere" add-on

**Why?** Browsers block requests to external APIs for security. This extension allows the app to fetch real product data from AJIO's servers.

### Step 2: Run the Project

1. **Clone the project:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RagulMylsamy27599/AJIO.git
cd AJIO
```

2. **Install packages:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the app:**

```bash
npm start
```

4. **Open your browser:**
   The app will open at `http://localhost:1234`
